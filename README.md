Image Classification using Neural Networks
Project Overview
This project aims to create a neural network model that can classify images into their respective categories. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and is implemented using the Keras library in Python.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a sample dataset containing images.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% for training and 20% for testing).
Model Architecture
The model consists of the following layers:
Conv2D (32 filters, kernel size 3x3, activation='relu')
MaxPooling2D (pool size 2x2)
Flatten()
Dense (64 units, activation='relu')
Dense (10 units, activation='softmax')
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function.
